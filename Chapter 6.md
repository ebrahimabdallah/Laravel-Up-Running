# Chapter 6. Frontend Components
 
# Breeze && Jetstream
* are used for authentication scaffolding in Laravel
* Breeze is more minimal and straightforward 
* Jetstream is more feature-rich and suitable for larger projects with more complex authentication requirements

* **Inertia**  is a JavaScript framework that allows you to build modern, single-page apps (SPAs) using server-side such frameworks Laravel
 

* **install Breeze**

```
composer require laravel/breeze --dev

php artisan breeze:instal

php artisan migrate

npm install

npm run dev

```

* **Jetstream** requires interactivity, so thereâ€™s no
Blade-only stack. Instead, you have two choices or Inertia/Vue 
* no React form for Jetstream

* installing 
* create project laravel

```
composer require laravel/jetstream

php artisan jetstream:install livewire

```
DB::table('posts')->paginate(number) 
```
* onEachSide() : concept of displaying a certain number of pages on each side of the current page in a pagination control.
```
Total Pages: 10

Current Page: 6

1 ... 4 5 [6] 7 8 ... 10

DB::table('posts')->paginate(10)->onEachSide(3);

```
* **LengthAwarePaginator** needs to know the length of the full result so
that it can generate links for each individual page

* Message Bag
* used to pass messages between different parts of a web application
* such : Validation Errors && Flashing Messages
* ithErrors() : send errors along with a redirect
```
redirect('dashboard')->withErrors($validator, 'login')
